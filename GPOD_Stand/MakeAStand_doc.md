# A Simple Grow Light Stand
_**Make a stand for your GPOD-based grow light.**_
### Why a Stand?
With a GPOD grow light controller and some serially programmable LED lights (WS2812 etc) you can generate the violet-spectrum light your plants and seedlings like in a day/night cycle with little cost and effort. But you'll need some way to suspend the light above your plant pots or trays.  That's where a simple stand come in.

In this section a couple of simple designs are offered.  

Perhaps the simplest design is no stand at all. Just use existing shelves, and suspend the SPLEDs under a shelf. If adjustable it's even better and you can lower the shelf below as your plants grow to keep the SPLED rings or strings or arrays at the optimal height.

### The Yoghurt Stand
An easy-to-make stand is using a yoghurt or similar tub or can, and cutting away one side.  A few holes punched in the bottom (soon to be the "top") will allow you to attach your SPLED ring or array, and another hole will allow you to route the control and power wires out to the GPOD controller.

The snap-on lid for the GPOD is the 'back' of the unit. You can mount that with some double-sided tape against the top of the yoghurt container. Or you can just sit the unit along side the light stand, or screw it down to the surface if you wish. (The photos show a unit with very short wiring, but with a longer wire between your control unit and lights, you can place it as convenient for your location). 

The pictures here will show one constructed for that purpose. 

### The Stick Stand
With a small bit of woodworking you can make a stick stand. It's mostly cutting and drilling - maybe a bit of sanding?  

The pictures shared for the simple wooden stand use only a few pieces of wood (github wdStdMake_xx.jpg).  

You can probably find some bits of 1x2" and 2x4" if you have done some wood working in the past.  Otherwise, you can get one length each of 1x2 and 2x4 at a local building supply store.

The lengths are arbitrary - size them to the height of pots you have, or the space you have available.  The example shown uses a strip of plywood for the vertical (and the spacers) but you can use 1x2 for that too. 

Buy a bolt with a wing-nut of appropriate size to reach through the assembled top piece with a few millimetres to spare (eg. 1/4").

I used dowels to assembled the base, through both the spacer and the vertical piece. A bit of glue and clamping holds it together nicely. 

The spacer in the cross piece didn't need a dowel as it is light weight, and won't support more than a few grams of weight from the LEDs. 

The pictures are pretty self explanatory. See the exploded-view diagrams too if that helps understand assembly.

### Your Imagination is the Limit

Much more elaborate designs are possible of course. Maybe you'll be inspired while making your first stand and come up with something better, more adjustable and more attractive.
