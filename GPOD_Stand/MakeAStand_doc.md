#A Simple Grow Light Stand
_**Make a stand for your GPOD-based grow light.**_
### Why a Stand?
With a GPOD grow light controller and some serially programmable LED lights (WS2812 etc) you can generate the violet-spectrum light your plants and seedlings like in a day/night cycle with little cost and effort. But you'll need some way to suspend the light above your plant pots or trays.  That's where a simple stand come in.

In this section a couple of simple designs are offered.  

Perhaps the simplest design is no stand at all. Just use existing shelves, and suspend the SPLEDs under a shelf. If adjustable it's even better and you can lower the shelf below as your plants grow to keep the SPLED rings or strings or arrays at the optimal height.

### The Yoghurt Stand
An easy-to-make stand is using a yoghurt or similar tub or can, and cutting away one side.  A few holes punched in the bottom (soon to be the "top") will allow you to attach your SPLED ring or array, and another hole will allow you to route the control and power wires out to the GPOD controller.

The pictures here will show one constructed for that purpose. 

### The Stick Stand
With a small bit of woodworking you can make a stick stand. It's mostly cutting and drilling - maybe a bit of sanding?  

Much more elaborate designs are possible of course. Maybe you'll be inspired while making your first stand and come up with something better, more adjustable and more attractive.
