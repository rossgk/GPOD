# GPOD Project Overview
### Readme file

*GPOD* is a small project based around an Arduino Nano (5V) with the primary goal
of enabling a simple growlight based on serially programmable LED devices. You can 
sprout some seedlings and coax a plant along in an otherwise dim space for not much 
cost. Buy the GPOD system fully functional and in an enclosure on Tindie.  A kit of 
parts is also available if you wish to build it yourself.

Documentation is provided here to orient the new user to the project and the basic 
control and configuration.  Experienced Arduino programmers can delve into the inner
workings and change behaviour or develop their own experiemental projects.

_GPOD_ has a _secondary function_ is as a simple environment for exploring SPLED
strings, rings, arrays or individual elements. You need a bit of electronics and
software knowledge to do this, then the documentation will help you along that path.

_GPOD_ has four control channels and selectable signalling through some micro (DIP) 
switches.  Check out the documentation for more information.
