GPOD is an Arduino Nano support board that lets you drive NeoPixel
or other similar serially programmable  RGB/W LEDs.

Buy the hardware on Tindie, and if you want to alter the code or 
configure it for something other than the out-of-the-box settings, 
you can use the code and documentation from this repository.
